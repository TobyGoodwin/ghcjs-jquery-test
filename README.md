# ghcjs-jquery-test
yesod-based test framework for ghcjs-jquery (currently just ajax)

Note that I haven't yet worked out how to get cabal to build the ghcjs
code. Build it manually like this:

    cd static/ghcjs
    ghcjs test.hs

This is currently for testing my own version of ghcjs-jquery (pull
requests have been made!)
